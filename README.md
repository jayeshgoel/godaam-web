## We are building an Inventory Management System for small-to-medium-sized businesses that enables efficient tracking, real-time inventory updates streamlined order processing

## Problem  being solved 
1. Dead Stock : Inventory that isn't selling can tie up capital that could be used for other purposes.

2. Supply chain disruptions : Poor supply chain management can lead to inventory confusion, which can result in storing too much or too little inventory. 

3. Difficulty in Demand Forecasting : Businesses often lack tools to predict demand accurately, leading to inventory imbalances. By integrating sales data analysis and historical trends, your system can provide demand forecasts, helping businesses plan better for seasonal or high-demand periods.
